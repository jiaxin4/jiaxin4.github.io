<h2 style="color:#87CEFA; font-size:2em;">Causal inference</h2>
**Summary**. My work in this area focuses on the development of statistical and causal models to make sense of complex longitudinal data. This includes models for assessing time-varying effect of an intervention and identifying effect modification. My methods focus on developing semiparametric models and constructing doubly robust estimators in causal inference.

**Summary**. I also work on Alzheimer's related research which applies statistical methodology to analyze rates of cognitive and functional decline, and examine clinical pathological correlations in the oldest-old.
