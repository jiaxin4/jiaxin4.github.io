Welcome, I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu), where I am advised by [Dr. Tianchen Qian](https://sites.google.com/view/tianchen-qian/home?authuser=0). Previously, I received my B.S. in Mathematics with a minor in Statistics from [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu). 




## Overview of My Research
I have broad research interests in causal inference, semiparametric theory, policy learning, experimental design, longitudinal methods, and machine learning. In particular, I have worked on the following,

- estimate causal effects in longitudinal settings with time-varying treatments;
- develop doubly robust estimator in the presence of missing data;
- derive semiparametric models in causal inference;
- Applying statistical methods to Alzheimerâ€™s disease research.
